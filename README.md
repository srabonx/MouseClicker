# MouseClicker
Automatic mouse clicker

Second Version
Fixed minor bugs and added the ability start and stop the execution of the program using F6 button.
Please do note that this version requires a external library to function properly. Please download the libs folder with the necessary library.
Run it using the run.bat file and make sure you have necessary jdk folder in the same directory as the run.bat, libs folder and MouseClicker.jar.
Else you can run it using your customized run.bat file with properly changed locations.
