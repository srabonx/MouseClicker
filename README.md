# MouseClicker
Automatic mouse clicker

Fourth Version Fixed minor bugs and added the feature of adding and deleting multiple clicks.

Please do note that this version requires a external library to function properly. Please download the libs folder with the necessary library. Run it using the run.bat file and make sure you have necessary jdk folder in the same directory as the run.bat, libs folder and MouseClicker.jar. Else you can run it using your customized run.bat file with properly changed locations.
