# MouseClicker
Automatic mouse clicker

Third Version Fixed minor bugs and added a major feature of picking up x and y location from the app itself.

Please do note that this version requires a external library to function properly.
Please download the libs folder with the necessary library.
Run it using the run.bat file and make sure you have necessary jdk folder in the same directory as the run.bat, libs folder and MouseClicker.jar.
Else you can run it using your customized run.bat file with properly changed locations.
